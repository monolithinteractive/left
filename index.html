our flagship patient data-entry platform. TickiT cuts through barriers to 
effective clinical decision making by prioritizing patient experience. 
Already adopted by top healthcare leaders like Boston Children’s Hospital 
and CAMH, TickiT is specialized to focus on high-risk groups, such as those

<h1>Past Events</h1>

<h2><a href="/events/mHealthDemoCamp2.html">mHealthDemoCamp2</a></h2>
<p>mHealthDemoCamp2 was Thursday January 29</p>
<p>"On a wintery night, at the UW School of Pharmacy, in a lounge high up on the 7th floor overlooking the Tannery, gathered over 30 eager (but unsuspecting) mobile health developers. So what happens when you get 30+ mobile health developers into a room for show and tell? Community building, that’s what!"
