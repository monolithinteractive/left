<h3>Simply Obstetrics - Dan Finnigan from <a href="https://www.simplycharting.com">Simply Charting</a></h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img style="width:300px;" src="/images/mhealthdemocamp2/simplycharting.png">
<p>Simply Obstetrics is a point-of-care reference App for managing pregnant patients in primary care. It follows through from routine care in pregnancy to normal labour and delivery, also covering obstetrical emergencies. The bullet-point topic primers give you the answers you need at the time you need them, based on current Canadian obstetrical guidelines produced by the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC), MoreOB, and ALARM (a course to train caregivers how to manage obstetrical emergencies). The App also has a useful reference section, including pregnancy categories for common prescriptions, acronym definitions, mnemonics, and calculators. We hope to keep developing and improving this project to make it the de facto go-to obstetrics App out there.

<h2>What is mHealthDemoCamp all about?</h2>

<p>mHealthDemoCamp is a free event where people show off something they’ve built. It’s an social event for local entrepreneurs, designers and developers to come together, share some food and drink and hang out. It’s also a time to watch demos of the cool and interesting things being built in our community. 

<h2>Demo Your Stuff</h2>

<p>Want to Demo your stuff? Awesome! What does it take have an awesome demo? Keep these key things in mind:</p>

<ul>
	<li>DemoCamp is Geek Show &amp; Tell for something you’ve built. It’s not a pitch night or Dragon’s Den.
	<li>You’ve only got 5 minutes! Pick a specific feature that will interest the crowd and demo that.
	<li>Focus your message. What’s the 1 thing the audience needs to remember – make sure they do!
	<li>Be prepared for technology to fail and keep presenting.
	<li>This is a community event of peers who appreciate you putting the time in to show what your passionate about so chill and enjoy the experience.
