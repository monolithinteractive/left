<h1>Past Events</h1>

<h2><a href="/events/mHealthDemoCamp2.html">mHealthDemoCamp2</a></h2>
<p>mHealthDemoCamp2 was Thursday January 29</p>
<p>"On a wintery night, at the UW School of Pharmacy, in a lounge high up on the 7th floor overlooking the Tannery, gathered over 30 eager (but unsuspecting) mobile health developers. So what happens when you get 30+ mobile health developers into a room for show and tell? Community building, thatâ€™s what!"

<h2>mHealthDemoCamp1</h2>
<p>The first event was held at MaRS on December 13, 2012.</p>
<p>Here was the <a href="http://monolithapps.com/blog/mhealth-democamp">original announcement</a></p>

<q>We have more than 30 mobile health experts and entrepreneurs in room CR-3 at MaRS, a highly informative keynote, 6 five-minute demos, great Q&A, and then about ten of us went out for beers afterwards.
